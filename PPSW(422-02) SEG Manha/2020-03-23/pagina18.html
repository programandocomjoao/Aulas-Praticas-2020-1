		Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans<br>
		Way back up in the woods among the evergreens<br>
		There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood<br>
		Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
		Who never ever learned to read or write so well<br>
		But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell<br><br>

		Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Johnny B. Goode<br><br>

		He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
		Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track<br>
		Oh, the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade<br>
		Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made<br>
		People passing by they would stop and say<br>
		Oh my, but that little country boy can play<br><br>

		Go, go, go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Go, Johnny, go, go<br>
		Johnny B. Goode<br><br>

		His mother told him: Some day you will be a man<br>
		And you will be the leader of a big old band<br>
		Many people comin' from miles around<br>
		To hear you play your music 'till the sun go down<br>
		Maybe someday your name will be in lights<br>
		Sayin': Johnny B. Goode tonight<br><br>

		Go, go, go, Johnny, go<br>
		Go, go, go, Johnny, go<br>
		Go, go, go, Johnny, go<br>
		Go, go, go, Johnny, go<br>
		Go, Johnny B. Goode
